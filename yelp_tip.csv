EkEwyFQdTKau1UBEUCxnsw,2013-05-22,0,Screw this place. I am pretty straight forward about my comments. I can appreciate good food but I can also recognize a rip off. Service was poor. They smiled and engaged but came to my table maybe once plus when they brought the food to check on me. They charged me 3 bucks per soda without telling me they charge for refills. 9 bucks for 3 half filled sprites. Rip off warning. The food was good. The steak was cooked nicely but for a $35 meal I could have ha a fillet somewhere. Bad recommendation,tip,dq_RYy2S90qNyXa8L4urqw
