Rebecca's has served me well in times of need, be it their turkey sandwich with granny smith apples and cheddar cheese or their tuna melt on pumpernickel swirl, or an emergency birthday cake.

They know who I am when I come in the morning, and to get the pre-prepared container of fruit (CANTELOUPE, ONLY CANTELOUPE) & his regular breakfast sandwich (plain bagel, bacon, egg, & swiss) and approximately four packets of ketchup. No receipt. Gives me exact change. I'm kind of screwed if I lose a quarter or something along the way.

This place is good. Monday through Friday mornings are made better by the presence of Delicato. I try to expand my horizons past a bacon, egg and cheese (extra cheese) on a bagel, but it's just so delicious that I can't seem to deny it. Matched with a Vitamin Water or Nantucket Nectars and you'll have yourself a pretty excellent breakfast.

Lunch is also good. I'll be honest, I haven't had too much from there in terms of the lunch menu, but what I have had (BLT, grilled cheese with bacon) - I like bacon - is really tasty. You also get a pretty tangy side of pasta salad, always a nice bonus to any meal. There is also a pretty decent drink selection. Extra bonus? Their menu is available online, so if you aren't quite sure what you want that day, but you're really curious about the specials, just pop online and check it out. Awesome. I love a place that allows me to be fat and lazy at the same time.

I've gotta give props to the excellent staff. So friendly. They clearly don't judge me every time I go in and order the same thing for breakfast, and they even ask me if I am picking anything up for my friends at work. They started to recognize me only after a few visits, which is pretty awesome considering how swamped it can get in the morning.

Good amount of seating available, but don't expect to take a huge party there. It's a nice spot to sit down for lunch (or breakfast) and read the paper or a book. Just don't be that person who hogs the table when there are clearly people waiting to grab a seat.

Talk about food selection. I know, I know, I've only gotten the same thing over a couple times. But their menu is just so huge that I get overwhelmed and blurt out the first thing with bacon that comes to mind. That's another bonus to having the menu online. You can prep before going in and not be swayed by all the fall back easy things to order.

Hours are from Monday to Friday, open until 3, so it's definitely a great place to check out during the work week. It's worth making a few trips there as well because there are so many options.

I also enjoy their salads, especially the Mediterranean (Mixed greens, Feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, carrots, hummus, basil roasted pepper, pita chips) if I'm feeling like a lighter lunch.

Though I don't have the authority to speak on all of their sandwiches, they are well made and properly portioned. The only sub-par thing I have eaten at Delicato was a bowl of clam chowder (which I am very picky about anyways).

A lot of people go for the breakfast, but I've only ever been for lunch. Their sandwiches are generally spot on. The Cowgirl is a personal favorite although I always feel weird ordering it because it sounds like it's a version of The Cowboy but for women: it's not. It's an ooey-gooey brie melt with chicken breast and the right pairing with a sweet honey Dijon. I don't think I've ever really been disappointed by any of their sandwiches (although the boursin/roast beef wrap tastes like what I make with a few supplies from Shaw's, which is good but not worth the ~$7 price). 

The sandwiches all come with a side of pasta salad and a deli pickle which make quite a tasty lunch that's quite filling. Usually at around $7 it's a pretty good value, at least in terms on the area. 

M g/f loves their caprese salad for some reason, despite every time I sample it being pretty disappointed. It's sort of bland and seems like they just got all the same ingredients I again can pick up at Shaw's and do the exact same thing at home and have it come out slightly better for presumably cheaper. 

Always check their specials! They have 4 different chalkboards with different daily specials: one has the sandwiches, one has the salads, one has the daily soup selection, and the final one is the lunch special. They had corned beef on St. Paddy's Day and it was better than any of the ""Irish"" places I went.

I only know about this tiny cafe because I work around the corner. It is located on a side walkway in between downtown crossing and government center. Unimposing, it has its menu on display by the door, so you can check out its selection without having to walk in. But seriously, you're gonna find something you like, you might as well go in.

There is a decent selection of sandwiches, soups, salads, and hot foods. I've only had sandwiches, but if the other options are like those, then its definitely worth a try. The ingredients are fresh and of good quality. The sandwich options consist of turkey, chicken, roast beef, genoa salami, etc. They are paired with a variety of cheese including the standards provolone and swiss as well as some more esoteric varieties such as brie and mozzarella. ""The Favorite"" (ironically *my* favorite) has turkey, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, olive oil, roasted red peppers, and basil on a focaccia roll. (Also, the bread selection is fantastic and fresh. No stale or boring bread) The sandwich is served with a pasta salad and pickle. It's a perfect sized meal.

The only reason I don't attend Delicato Cafe too often are the prices. It is a little pricey (although nothing ridiculous). The difference is the sides. It's a little more than I'd like to pay on a regular basis, but I'll certainly stop in when I feel like treating myself.

BONUS - Delicato Cafe is now working with LevelUp, the app where you can pay with your smartphone and build toward bonus credit to spend at the restaurant.

However, things are flawed, very flawed. Today has pretty much reinforced why I don't go here often. 

I went during the lunch rush. So there was a decent line. There is little organization to keep the line moving from being ordered, carefully watching your order (and answer possible questions about it), to paying. They tell you to move along but they are constantly asking you questions. For example, they ran of our wheat today so they had to ask several people about which bread they would prefer instead. Luckily, I ordered my sandwich on a roll. 

So I get shuffled on to pay. Big mistake. I should have stood my ground and watched the woman make the sandwich. There was a breakdown in the ordering process since a guy took the order, told it to the woman, who was making like 5 other sandwiches at the same time. So, understandable, she messes up my order. I did not order anything complicated. Nope... salami, provolone cheese, lettuce, oil and vinegar. 

Once I got back to my office I realized that my sandwich was missing the oil and vinegar. That is the blue that ties the sandwich together! 

They need to either take the order and make it themselves or write out orders to get things done correctly when passing it off to someone else. Marking the sandwich would also be helpful since the 2 women at the register actually hand out the sandwiches so they are just yelling out what the woman who makes the sandwiches say. My sandwich was almost given to a man who ordered ham on white. Luckily they realized a bread sandwich felt different than a roll sandwich.

I'm torn between giving two and three stars. I like using Plaza Deli as my ""old faithful"" ... my last minute ""hail mary play"" ... when I just can't make up my mind, I know I can go to Plaza Deli (or their sister deli, Cafe Latino) for a nice sized and well portioned lunch. However, there are real issues here that can't be avoided.  

I work in the area and I tend to visit Plaza Deli maybe once a week because of a decently portioned chicken ceasar wrap I can get there.  

Most of the staff recognize my face, but not to the point where my name is known. Meh....I'm over it. 

I used to order a variety of lunches from Plaza Deli.  There was the roast turkey lunch plate, various salads, ziti with sausage, roast beef, steak and cheese, cheeseburger subs...I did it all.  But mistakes would appear in my orders more than I could allow.  Those mistakes happen primarily because of the ordering system. 

Other reviewers have mentioned it already, and I would like to reinforce what they have said.  I want to give 3 stars, because the food is good enough, but the disorganization in this place along with the high prices and the VERY public family strife going on in the background can really turn a customer off.  

So, two stars it is. (Really should be 2.5)

I echo the calls from other Yelpers for an organized way to order your lunch from this staff.   The customer is annoyingly herded toward the register before he/she is comfortable that anyone actually understands the order. 

I ask the staff at Plaza Deli, ""why can't someone write down my order on a piece of paper and hand it to the order maker?""

I agree that the price for a lunch which includes chips, a drink and a sandwich regularly rises above $10.  A bit high in this area and in this economy.  

There is a deal of some sort if you work in the building or at the state court across the plaza.  I sadly don't qualify for such a deal. 

I ask the staff at the Plaza Deli, ""why not offer a lunch club card for everyone?""  

Recently, they instituted a lunch bag special for around $7.50 with tax where you get a sandwich, chips and a bottle of water (or select sodas).  That ain't bad.  Keep up those initiatives and I think you will get more positive feedback. 

Lastly, STOP THE INCESSANT BICKERING BEHIND THE COUNTER WITH EACH OTHER.   It is so unprofessional and such a turn off to the customers.  Don't let us go in there at least once a month and find two staff members having an issue with each other.   I even catch the employees at Cafe Latino having problems with the Plaza Deli employees. I know you are all family back there, and we all have our own family problems, but honestly...cut it out at the shop.",review,FT_6c26VcTiEy1t1ZMpY9Q,"{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 1, u'cool': 0}"SAnMTC1rm-PhP8DQC4zeyg,7/21/11,W9jItSgRfyp5PpxHGP36Dg,3,"Changed my mind....They don't deserve two stars.

Sooooo good. How good? Good enough that it essentially single-handedly destroyed my newfound personal austerity. As someone who enjoys going out to eat and drink, but doesn't have much money, I decided that I'd commit myself to really limiting stuff I don't need to get; I can make coffee at home, and pack my lunch for work - save, save, save. And I was doing well with it too, which is unlike me.

Then one morning I was sleepy, in a rush, had some cash in my pocket, and really needed some coffee. I passed by the Capitol Coffee House and figured, eh, just this once. And boom, there it was, and now it's over. I'm in there pretty much every day.

The coffee is heavenly, in my opinion; put some cream and sugar in it and it goes down like hot cocoa - smooth and delicious. The large coffee is also super big for $1.90 and provides a heck of a jolt, especially on a frigid Boston morning.

Since giving into the coffee I've also started trying food there and it's all been excellent for the price. I expected the breakfast to be really good - eggs, bacon, sausage, etc., all top notch. But what surprised me was how good lunch was. I had an Italian Sub that honestly rivaled my favorite, Uptown Caf̩, in terms of deliciousness and crispiness of the bread, as well as the freshness of the ingredients.

For a location right in the heart of Beacon Hill the prices are phenomenal, and as has been mentioned by other reviewers, the staff here is great and really puts me in a great mood in the morning. They're mostly all Italian guys from, I think, Naples and seem like they're either friends or family. The clientele consists largely of outgoing regulars and the staff gets to know them well; one guy working behind the counter noticed my Liverpool soccer scarf and now talks to me every day about how his beloved Naples team is doing.

No, its not that the coffee stinks, in fact its great!  Can't beat a large iced coffee for 2.20 with a flavor shot.  It's not the best, but its very solid coffee.  The iced especially, because they used slushed ice and very large sugar crystals that you pretty much crunch when you get a good sip (note the irish cream flavor for their coffee literally is an espresso shot of its own...try it!).

So if not the coffee, its the rude service?  Nope.  These guys are great; a bunch of old Italian guys cooking food and serving coffee.  its awesome; it reminds me of my mom's side of the family, as they really are a prime 
example of old Italian dudes.

Finally, its the food right?  Right??  Well...yeah sort of.  The food itself is fine; in fact i dare say its very good, no matter what you get.  my main issue is the prices for food.  The coffee is incredibly cheap, but the food seems too high for me.  C'mon man, 6 bucks + change for a steak and cheese sandwich??  They're not exactly the largest sandwiches either.  I don't know, maybe uptown cafe has spoiled me for quality sandwiches at fair prices; hell their 6 dollar sandwiches are easily 14 inches.  

All that aside, its a solid dining establishment filled with Massachusetts Government employees, and probably the best coffee shop in the city as far as quality and price is concerned (seriously for their prices, i don't think the world's best coffee for 4 bucks will even top it!)",review,zDhJKFf23pM-nGjRJ1iTdQ,"{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}"75dtVyDb8Sfwb7dR0cBvdg,6/16/11,#NAME?,3,"They serve breakfast sandwiches all day.
